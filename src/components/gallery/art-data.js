      link: html`Penguins are a group of aquatic flightless birds. They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere, with only one species, the Galapagos penguin, found north of the equator. Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage, and their wings have evolved into flippers.`,

      link:html`
      The average lifespan of fur seals varies with different species from 13 to 25 years, with females typically living longer. Most populations continue to expand as they recover from previous commercial hunting and environmental threats. Many species were heavily exploited by commercial sealers, especially during the 19th century, when their fur was highly valued.

      link: html`The bottlenose dolphin is recognized today as two distinct species—the common bottlenose dolphin and the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin. They live in groups numbering about a dozen individuals, and learn at an early age the complex social skills they need to survive. Dolphins live off fish. Because they live so close to the shore, they are threatened by by-catch, coastal development and environmental degradation. Dolphins are very social creatures!`,

While some populations are now stable and growing, poaching, conflict and habitat destruction continue to threaten the species. Baby Elephants can weigh as much as 250 pounds at birth!`,

They rely on prairie dogs for food and their burrows for shelter and raising young. Consequently, their fate is directly linked to that of prairie dogs. As a result of habitat loss and non-native disease, black-footed ferret populations declined to the brink of extinction in the 20th century.`,

      text: 'Swimming Sea Turtle',
      link: html`
      In general, sea turtles have a more fusiform body plan than their terrestrial or freshwater counterparts. 
      This tapering at both ends reduces volume and means sea turtles can't, as can other turtles and tortoises, 
      retract their head and limbs into their shells for protection. But the streamlined body plan reduces friction and 
      drag in the water and allows sea turtles to swim more easily and swiftly.
