<font face="Bahnschrift SemiBold, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Derek
Hobbs born and raised New London, CT. Is now a Madison, WI based
artist. He lives with his wife and 3 beautiful children. He is always
discovering, always experimenting and never settling. Derek is mostly
a self-taught artist, though he did complete the first semester of
the Graphic Design program at Madison College. His other education is
very diverse and informs the way he works, he holds a Bachelor’s of
Science from Ball State University in Natural Resources Studies and a
Web Software Developer Associates of Applied Sciences from Madison
College. The ideology of his work is underpinned by his love of God,
nature and the environment and the human condition. Where some of his
series such as his Alaskan Landscape and Endangered Animals he
borders on realistic representation and a more crude realistic
approach caring less about the details to probe more of the essence
of his subject.  </font></font>

<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Bahnschrift SemiBold, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">	Working
in acrylic, oil, digital, photography and mixed media he brings his
ideas and emotions alive on canvas and wood panel. His influences are
derived from many sources, such as the impressionists, abstract
expressionists, surrealists, pop art, realists, post modernists,
design, nature, his kids, music and the list goes on. He describes it
as putting everything into a coffee or tea fueled blender, to tap his
subconscious where effulgent creations manifest themselves into this
world.</font></font></p>

Art In, various local coffee shops and at the Alicia Ashman Library
located in Middleton, WI. While living in Indiana, Derek displayed
some of his work at local coffee shops and a local pottery shop
called the Artist Within. While there he created a street art piece
along the greenway. During his time in Fayetteville, NC he worked on
several pieces that ended up being stolen, work here also included a
small mural of a beach theme for a local Beach Bingo business.
Growing up in CT, Derek worked under John DeNardis, an artist whom
builds custom store front displays for such clients as F.A.O Schwarz
in NYC. He also worked as a painter doing stencil work for the Garde
Arts Theater renovation project in the 90’s. Derek’s work has
been shown at the local Hygienic Art Gallery during their annual
everyone is an artist show. </font></font>
